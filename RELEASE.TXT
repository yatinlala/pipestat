        dm:       [R] some new operators added, bugs fixed
        dm:       [F] random seed now follows R[AND] operator
        dm:       [M] no longer checks for non-numerical inputs (use number(si))
        dsort:    [+] for sorting data files by columns
        ff:       [+] for pagination, simple text formatting
