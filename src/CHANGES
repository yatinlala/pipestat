This file contains some highlights of the changes to |STAT.

Tue Jan  8 19:56:25 EST 1985
ALL	plan for syntax standard changes
	I am now using the getopt command line option parser for
	many of the programs.  Eventually, all the programs will
	use it so that the command syntax is consistent and
	conforms to the Hemenway & Armitage UNIX standard.
REGRESS major changes
	Now only the first column is the predicted variable.
	Previously, all variables were predicted with all others;
	this was because it was easy, not for any good reason.
	Added functionality includes significance tests to
	see if individual variables add to the others.
	This should promote better analyses.
DATAPLOT new program
	This program is an interim replacement for the plotting
	capabilities of the PAIR program (AKA BIPLOT).  It allows
	defining more information about the axes.
COLEX	new program
	This program provides the column extraction capabilities
	of DM and is provided for systems that do not have YACC
	so that they can compile DM.  In some ways, it is superior
	to DM as a column extractor because it allows ranges of
	columns to be specified.
MORE	new program
	This program is available on most Berkeley UNIX systems.
	This simplified version allows paging on systems that
	don't have it.

Fri Feb  1 14:25:39 EST 1985
CALC	bug fixed
	Calc used to blow up with recursive expressions like
		a = 12
		a = a + 1
	Now it checks for recursion and prints an error message.

Thu Feb  7 01:43:31 EST 1985
DM	portability enhancements and better expression printer
	DM used to assume that all data types were of size int.
	Now all sorts of non-portable casts that did not work
	on MS_DOS have been replaced by strong typing.  It should
	not affect any UNIX versions of the program.

Mon Feb 11 17:19:48 EST 1985
POF	better approximation added to reduce rounding errors.

Sat Feb 23 11:26:56 EST 1985

most programs now only read stdin and write stdout
most programs now use getopt for command line option handling
