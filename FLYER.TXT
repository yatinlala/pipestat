|STAT 5.4: DATA MANIPULATION & ANALYSIS PROGRAMS FOR UNIX and MSDOS

|STAT is a set of about 30 data manipulation and analysis programs
developed by Gary Perlman at the University of California, San
Diego and at the Wang Institute.  The manipulation programs are
general utilities that work with other standard programs like sort. 
The analysis programs compute most widely used statistics.  |STAT
programs are designed with the philosophy that individual programs
should be designed as tools that do one task well and produce
output suitable for input via pipes to |STAT and other programs. 
Interactive use is supported in the command line interpreter/editor
while batch files or shell scripts provide a programming language
for complex analyses.  Typical usage involves a pipeline of
transformations of data followed by input to an analysis program,
summarized schematically by:

   INPUT DATA | TRANSFORM | ANALYSIS | OUTPUT RESULTS

Package Features
================
 * simple input formats (free-format field-oriented)
 * flexible data manipulation
 * several simple lineprinter plotting options
 * data validation (range and type checking)
 * consistent option conventions with online help
 * compiles and runs on any UNIX System
   (V6, V7, 2.8 BSD, 4.x BSD, System V, ANSI, etc.)
 * runs on MSDOS/PCDOS 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x with 96K
   (IBM, AT&T, Epson, and all compatibles)
 * usually less than a few seconds per analysis

Distribution Conditions
=======================
CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS.  IF YOU DO NOT FIND THEM
ACCEPTABLE, YOU SHOULD NOT USE |STAT.

   |STAT IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTY.  THE USER ASSUMES ALL RISKS OF USING |STAT.  THERE IS NO
CLAIM OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
|STAT MAY NOT BE SUITED TO YOUR NEEDS.  |STAT MAY NOT RUN ON YOUR
PARTICULAR HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION.  THE AVAILABILITY OF
AND PROGRAMS IN |STAT MAY CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.  NEITHER
MANUFACTURER NOR DISTRIBUTOR BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY MISHAP OR
ECONOMIC LOSS RESULTING THEREFROM OF THE USE OF |STAT EVEN IF THE
PROGRAMS PROVE TO BE DEFECTIVE.  |STAT IS NOT INTENDED FOR CONSUMER
USE.

   CASUAL USE BY USERS NOT TRAINED IN STATISTICS, OR BY USERS NOT
SUPERVISED BY PERSONS TRAINED IN STATISTICS, MUST BE AVOIDED. 
USERS MUST BE TRAINED AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE TO LEARN TO USE THE
PROGRAMS.  DATA ANALYSIS PROGRAMS MAKE MANY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT DATA,
THESE ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF CONCLUSIONS MADE BASED ON
THE PROGRAMS.  REFERENCES TO SOME APPROPRIATE STATISTICAL SOURCES
ARE MADE IN THE |STAT HANDBOOK AND IN THE MANUAL ENTRIES FOR
SPECIFIC PROGRAMS.  |STAT PROGRAMS HAVE NOT BEEN VALIDATED FOR
LARGE DATASETS, HIGHLY VARIABLE DATA, NOR VERY LARGE NUMBERS.

   You may make copies of any tangible forms of |STAT programs,
provided that there is no material gain involved, and provided that
the information in this notice accompanies every copy.  You may not
copy printed documentation unless such duplication is for non-
profit educational purposes.  You may not provide |STAT as an
inducement to buy your software or hardware or any products or
services.  You may distribute copies of |STAT, provided that mass
distribution (such as electronic bulletin boards or anonymous ftp)
is not used.  You may not modify the source code for any purposes
other than getting the programs to work on your system.  Any costs
in compiling or porting |STAT to your system are your's alone, and
not any other parties.  You may not distribute any modified source
code or documentation to users at any sites other than your own.

Free FTP and Email Access
=========================
|STAT is available via anonymous ftp in pub/stat at:
   archive.cis.ohio-state.edu (128.146.8.52)
The file:
   stat.tar.Z.crypt.uu
is the uuencoded, encrypted, compressed, tar archive of the
package.  To unpack the archive, you need uudecode, (de)crypt,
uncompress, and tar.  To ensure that the distribution restrictions
on |STAT are maintained, a password has been attached to the
archive.  To obtain the password you must send
perlman@cis.ohio-state.edu a message containing:
   I AGREE TO ADHERE TO THE CONDITIONS OF USING |STAT.
   I AGREE NOT TO SHARE THE |STAT PASSWORD WITH OTHERS.
After obtaining the file, which you can also request from me via
email, you should run the following commands:
   uudecode < stat.tar.Z.crypt.uu
   crypt < stat.tar.Z.crypt > stat.tar.Z
   uncompress stat.tar.Z
   tar xvf stat.tar
You should then have a stat directory that will take up about a
megabyte.  In the stat/src directory, you should make any necessary
changes to the makefile and then run make to build the package.  In
addition to the online manuals, the file handbook.txt contains a
lineprinter version of the |STAT handbook.  The troff source to the
handbook is not yet structured enough for ftp distribution.

If you do not have access to some of the programs (many people do
not have access to crypt) you can ask that I email you the file
stat.tar.Z.uu (about 800 Kbytes) along with the line:
   I AGREE TO ADHERE TO THE CONDITIONS OF USING |STAT.

The compiled DOS version of |STAT can be ftp'd from pub/stat/DOS.
Use binary transfer mode for the executable files (i.e., *.exe).
No permission or password is needed to access the DOS version,
but a note informing perlman@cis.ohio-state.edu would be appreciated.
