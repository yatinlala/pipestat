REVERSE(1)                         |STAT                       October 1985

NAME
     reverse - reverse lines, fields or characters within lines

SYNOPSIS
     reverse [-cfl]

DESCRIPTION
     _r_e_v_e_r_s_e reverses lines, space separated fields, or characters within
     lines read from the standard input.

OPTIONS
     -c   reverse characters within lines.

     -f   reverse fields within lines.  Fields are separated by any white
          space (e.g., tabs, blanks), and may be delimited by double or
          single quotes to allow inclusion of spaces inside fields.  When
          fields are reversed, any white space between fields is replaced
          by a single tab.  There is a limit to the number of fields that
          can be reversed; see the -L option.

     -l   reverse lines.  This is the default action when no options are
          selected.  There is a limit to the number of lines that can be
          reversed; see the -L option.

EXAMPLES
     echo 11 21 31 41 51 61  |  reverse -c
          16 15 14 13 12 11
     echo 11 21 31 41 51 61  |  reverse -f
          61 51 41 31 21 11
     echo 11 21 31 41 51 61  |  reverse -fc
          11 12 13 14 15 16

LIMITS
     Use the -L option to determine the program limits.
