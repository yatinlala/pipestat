VALIDATA(1)                        |STAT                   February 3, 1987

NAME
     validata - validate and report columnar file consistency

SYNOPSIS
     validata

DESCRIPTION
     _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_a reads a file from the standard input and for each column in
     its input, reports statistics about the data type of fields (whether a
     column contains alphanumeric strings, integers, real numbers, or
     something else).  _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_a also reports the maximum and minimum values
     of the columns; _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_a is useful to check data files for consistency
     before input to some data analysis program because it detects missing
     columns or columns of the wrong type, such as non-numeric input.
