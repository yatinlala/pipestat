NAME
     cat - concatenate files by printing them one after another

SYNOPSIS
     cat [files] [-]

DESCRIPTION
     _c_a_t prints its argument files one after the other.  The special file
     name - is taken to mean the standard input; this allows inserting the
     standard input in between a series of files.  If not files are named,
     the standard input is read.

EXAMPLES
     cat a b c   # print files a, b, and c on the standard output
     echo ----- | cat a - b   # print a, a line, and b

NOTE
     This program is supplied for systems that do not have _c_a_t or some
     other program to join a series of files.  It is a bare bones version
     with no options.
