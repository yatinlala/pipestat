ABUT(1)                            |STAT                   November 2, 1985

NAME
     abut - formatted printing of corresponding lines from files

SYNOPSIS
     abut [-cn] [-f format] [-] file1 file2 ...

DESCRIPTION
     _a_b_u_t makes a list of files with N lines into one file with N lines by
     printing all the first lines of those files on one line, then the
     second lines, and so on, until all the lines from the longest file
     have been printed (but see the -_c option).  _a_b_u_t reads from its file
     arguments in the order they appear in the call to _a_b_u_t and prints to
     the standard output.  As a special case, the file name "-" is used as
     the standard input.  Any white space at the end of lines is removed,
     but at least one space between fields from different files is
     guaranteed.

OPTIONS
     -c   Cycle through lines of short files until longest is exhausted.
          _a_b_u_t Continue printing until all files have been exhausted once.
          Files with fewer lines than the longest will be rewound and
          printed again.  The standard input cannot be recycled.

     -f format
          Print fields in the specified format.  Positive integers specify
          the field width.  Negative integers imply a left-justified field.
          The default printing format is to put a tab between corresponding
          lines of separate files.

     -n   All output lines are _n_u_m_b_e_r_e_d beginning with 1.

EXAMPLE
     _a_b_u_t is often used to create input files to _a_n_o_v_a.
