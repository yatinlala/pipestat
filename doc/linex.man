NAME
     linex - line extraction

SYNOPSIS
     linex [-ns] line-numbers

DESCRIPTION
     _l_i_n_e_x extracts the named lines from the standard input and prints them
     to the standard output.  Line numbers begin with 1.  Ranges of line
     numbers can be abbreviated with arguments of the form #-# (e.g., 12-
     24).  Line ranges can be in reverse order (e.g., 5-1 to reverse the
     first five lines).

OPTIONS
     -n   Number output lines.

     -s   Silent running.  By default, _l_i_n_e_x complains if you request a
          line not found in the file.  This option turns off the warning
          messages.

EXAMPLES
     linex 1 2 3 4       # lines 1 through 4
     linex 1-4           # an abbreviation of the above
     linex 4-1           # lines 4-1 in reverse order
     linex -s 500-1000   # lines 500 to 1000, if they are there

LIMITS
     There is a limit on the maximum number of lines you can print;
     probably 1000.  Use the -L option to determine the program limits.
