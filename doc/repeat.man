REPEAT(1)                          |STAT                   October 13, 1986

NAME
     repeat - repeat input strings or files

SYNOPSIS
     repeat [-fi] [-l maxlines] [-n count] [-] [files]

DESCRIPTION
     _r_e_p_e_a_t repeatedly prints its argument files as many times as
     requested.  If no files are specified, the standard input is read.
     The special file name - is allowed to refer to the standard input.

OPTIONS
     -f   Insert a formfeed before each repetition.  This allows pagination
          of output for most printers.

     -i   Repeat lines inside files.  For example, if a file has the days
          of the week, each on its own line, then two copies with this
          option will produce:
          Sunday
          Sunday
          Monday
          Monday
           ...

     -l maxlines
          Set the maximum number of lines to be read.

     -n count
          Set the number of repetitions of each input file.  By default,
          one copy is printed.

EXAMPLES
          repeat -n 10                  # input from tty is reprinted 10 times
          pr file | repeat -n 5         # pr output is repeated five times
          echo hello | repeat -n 20     # 20 hello's are printed
          repeat -n 20 hello            # the file hello is repeated

BUGS
     The name _r_e_p_e_a_t is a reserved word in _c_s_h. The program should be
     installed as _r_e_p instead.

LIMITS
     Use the -L option to determine the program limits.
