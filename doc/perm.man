     _p_e_r_m reads lines from the standard input and prints them in permuted
     order.  By default, this order is random, but the order can be sorted
     numerically or alphabetically with options.

     ----aaaa   Sort lines by alphabetic ordering.  Initial blank space is not
          ignored.
     ----cccc   Use a case-insensitive comparison and sort by alphabetic
          ordering.
     ----eeee   Sort lines by exponential (scientific) notation ordering.
          Initial blank space is ignored.  This method does true numerical
          sorting for all numbers, but is much slower than integer or
          numerical sorting.
     ----iiii   Sort lines by integer ordering.  Initial blank space is ignored.
     ----jjjj   Control juxtaposition of adjacent input lines.  By default,
          adjacent input lines can come out next to each other.  With this
          option, if two input lines are next to each other, then they will
          not be next to each other in the output.  For the purposes of
          this program, the very first and very last lines are considered
          to be next to each other.  It is impossible to produce non-
          juxtaposed output from four lines or less.  It is unknown whether
          all non-juxtaposed permutations are equally probable.
     ----llll   Set the maximum number of lines to be read.
     ----nnnn   Sort lines by special numeric ordering.  Numbers with decimal
          points are allowed, and compared by a special fast sorting
          algorithm that is almost as fast as integer sorting.
     ----rrrr   Reverse the order of comparison for sorting options.
     ----ssss   Provide an integer seed for the random number generator.
          Otherwise, the seeding is done with the process number and the
          time, or, on some systems, by prompting for a seed.

     The program duplicates some of the _s_o_r_t program's functions, but
     provides true numerical sorting for MSDOS whose _s_o_r_t only does
     alphabetic sorts.

     Use the -L option to determine the program limits.
